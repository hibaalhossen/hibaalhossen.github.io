The <div> is ///a container unit /// that encapsulates other page elements and divides the HTML document into sections. Web developers use <div> elements to group together HTML elements and apply CSS styles to many elements at once. For instance, by wrapping a set of paragraph elements into a <div> element, the developer can take advantage of CSS styles and apply a font to all paragraphs at once by applying a font style to the <div> tag instead of coding the same style for each paragraph element.
